## Get Rich Quick - Business Secrets

People will believe anything, as long as it gives them an easy answer to the most important question in the universe: "how can I become rich quickly and without working?"
"International reply coupon exchange" sounded just as cool and mysterious as "censorship-resistant money".

Investment opportunity: you can buy an inscription on an online registry that gives you absolutely no rights and no income. Also investors must pay $3B per year or the registry ceases to exist. BUT there's a limited number of registry entries so it must be worth a lot. #Bitcoin

If you see this tweet, it's your lucky day, because you'll be lambo-rich in less than 24 hours.
All you need to do is send 0.1 BTC to all the addresses at the bottom of this message, & retweet by putting your own Bitcoin address at the top of the list!

Happy Easter everyone.

Blockchain isn't a solution to fraud. There can be no technological fixes to human nature. If people want to believe that a 20-year-old nobody named Martin Shkreli will double their money in one year, no blockchain can save them.
Oh wait, I've just described 99% of ICO investors.

The crypto cartel's smartest propaganda move was to create the HODLer culture. By glorifying the act of doing nothing, they reached out to the self-entitled, lazy millionaire wannabes.
Every Ponzi scheme relies on the hope that investors won't sell.
This one's just too obvious.

DON'T BUY THE DIPS IN A FAILING PONZI SCHEME.
This is not financial advice. It's common sense.
It was also common sense not to buy magical virtual coins that will make you rich in no time on the Internet, but apparently some things need to be said more clearly.

Please explain me why you guys keep claiming that Bitcoin will change the world in every way, but then all your arguments boil down to its price.
You can bid up the price as much as you want,
especially when hordes of lemmings hodl & don't sell.  
But it doesn't change the world.

> You can't answer the question because you know you are doomed to fail!

I will accept that I'm wrong the day when it will be more convenient for me to use Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) than cash. This is what you should be focusing on. Pro tip: HODLing doesn't help to get the 99% of people who don't own crypto, on your side.


Why nobody cares about the "Lightning Network"? Because it has nothing to do with Bitcoin's fundamental promise: become rich without doing anything.
As long as Bitcoin's only interesting feature: its exponential price, is broken, people won't give a crap about your "technology".

## Tokens - Utility? Security? Currency?

Crypto split: the act of telling regulators that your token "isn't a security or
a currency, it's no more than a database entry, really - people who buy it
must be morons !", while simultaneously telling your investors that they're somehow buying a stake in the Next Big Thing.

## Greater Fools - BagHODLers Wanted

An investor buys an asset because he/she believes that it will generate future cash flows is greater than justify its price.
A crypto gambler buys a coin, no matter the price, because he/she believes that more people will buy it in the future.
It's a Ponzi scheme and you know it.

Crypto for dummies

"Dude, are you insane? You gave your money to some guy nobody knows, with no experience, no track record, no product, at a valuation of $30m?!"
"That's OK, I have a plan!" Takes another big gulp of kerosene. "I'm gonna sell my worthless coins to someone else!"
-- [30 Apr 2018](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/991053417048170496)


Piece of advice to all ICO investors: all product ideas, no matter how cool they sound, must be considered worthless until you meet someone who is ready to pay for said product.
Corollary: 95% of ICO ideas are shit. But you already knew that, and only bought in to flip the coins.

## (Just) Believe! HODL! HODL! HODL! To the Moon!

In the mind of a Bitcoiner, humanity is divided into two camps: those who have bought Bitcoin, a.k.a. the illuminated, and those who have not, and are doomed to live in a state of perpetual jealousy and hate towards the illuminated for their superior intelligence and foresight.

Bitcoin maximalists make me laugh with their pitiful P&Ls.
I found a weird stone the other day,
and we've been buying it from each other with a friend, ever since.

If everyone on Earth wants to own Bitcoin, its price will go up x1,000.
If everyone on Earth wants to own old postal stamps, their price will go up x1,000 too.
At least you can't create old postal stamps out of thin air with the exact same features.

Are HODLers the same people who used to buy land parcels on the Moon 20 years ago?
You get your name on some kind of an online registry: check.
You believe that you've purchased something valuable: check.

Your friends make fun of you: check.

Remember, crypto bagHODLers, if a guy believes crypto is a scam, it's because he doesn't own any. Not the other way around. That's how human brains work - first you do some random shit, and then you rationalise it.

## New New Economics - Crytpo Double Speak

Bitcoiners sound cool because they use crypto-slang. If nocoiners want to build a religion, they need their own cult-speak.
I've been pushing "bagHODLer" for a while, to no avail.
I'll continue to do so, but we need more.
How about "crater", which would be the opposite of "moon"?

"It's not the coin that has value, it's the consensus" is cryptospeak for "build it, and they will come". Coins supposedly have value because they'll bring together smart people who right now have no means of cooperating.
Because they don't know the Internet exists, or something.
-- [4 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/992505016719208453)

By now everyone has realized coins have no value per se because it's just copy - paste of some previous code, with new bugs on top. So you to rationalize the hallucination that they're not useless, worthless trash, we need some new bullshit. Here it comes: consensus is the value.





## Revolutionize the World - Crypto Innovations

Groundbreaking innovations are the exception, not the rule.
A lot of things can go south: wrong team, bad technology choices, the world isn't there yet.
That's why investments are made in tranches, with clear milestones.
ICOs are revolutionary in that they're a total clown act.

## No Freebies - No Taxes

It's amazing that so many people don't get how expensive crypto networks are. Networks pay miners rewards - for Bitcoin, it's around 1000 coins, or $8M, per day. Anyone can be a miner, so millions of crypto wannabes run their computers 24/7, burning said $8M/day in electricity.

People assume that calculations behind Bitcoin network are useful, because they are "very complex". They aren't.
They are the equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack, then throwing away the needle. The more people are looking for the needle, the bigger the haystack gets.

## There's Only Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a means to transfer money, nothing more.
It's like HODLers started to buy bank cheques, thinking, "whenever someone needs to write a cheque, they'll need to buy it from us".
"But whan if banks just print more cheques?"
"Ours are better because they are more expensive."

Not "WE THE" people, "SOME" people. The fact that YOU believe in magical virtual coins that transfer $3 billion per year from holders to miners, and try to convince everyone else to throw their money into this scam, is YOUR decision, while MY responsibility is to warn people.



## Do Your Own Reading - What's a Book?

If you think books about the history of finance, financial regulation, and banking crises are a waste of time... Buying Bitcoin will be an expensive way to find out why we have regulations, securities laws, and that you didn't have it all figured out after reading McAfee's tweets.

I don't know what a side chain is. I don't know how exactly the Lightning Network is supposed to work.

When you buy a company's shares, you get voting rights, plus a share of the profits.
When you buy ICO tokens, you get nothing - no voting rights, no share of any future profits, plus the tokens bleed money because miners have to be rewarded.

Crypto shill's starter pack:

1. Fraud sometimes happens in regulated markets too, so it's ok if it's rampant in crypto.
2. Some ICOs are legitimate, so it's like all of crypto is legitimate.
3. We're doing cutting edge innovation, but have nothing to show because it takes time.

Of the 902 ICOs listed on Tokendata for 2017, 46% have already failed, and 13% are deemed "unresponsive" to questions on social media.

-- [24 Mar 2018](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/977440607839891456)


An ICO is basically all rounds of funding in one go for a business without a business plan, customers, or even a product. And even if the team, by some miracle, manages to accomplish something, you have no claim on their success because all you have are stupid coins, not shares.

Your argument is bullshit. BTC didn't ICO. It wasn't created to get a lot of money quick
from people who don't understand what they're buying. Implying that ICOs are comparable
to Bitcoin is a criminal lie. Bitcoin was an accident. ICOs are intentional scams.



### Terms and Conditions

Current EOS token market cap: $15 billion.
The EOS token is a nothing. Literally nothing. See the excerpt from its purchasing agreement below.
This is a $15 billion scam in broad daylight, and morons invested in it think they're geniuses because the fake price of scamcoins is up.

The issue here is that ICOs exploit the implicit trust people have in markets. This trust was created by regulations where bad guys get punished. So retail investors, when they are offered an investment, believe that they won't get screwed by default. You can't have it both ways.

The world has become way too complex for people to read all the terms & conditions on every piece of packaging.
If we had to distrust everything and everyone at every step,
it's back to the Middle Ages.





ICO Terms & Conditions are always a  fun read, unless you intend to "invest" in the ICO. Then it's a pile of rotten garbage that screams "run away, you moron!"
Here's a fun one: "the coins you purchase are nothing, and might never become anything at any time in the future."

## Creative Disruption - Austrian School of Economics - Free Market Paradise

Theory:
"Blockchain tech is great, it will eliminate fraud and corruption."

Practice:
"Most ICOs are scams, crypto exchanges are crooked, so what? It sometimes happens in the real world, too."

## Bitcoin Gold Standard - Austrian School of Economics - Free Market Paradise


Bitcoiners try so hard to look like technological visionaries. They keep quoting the Austrian school of economics, something that's less of an economic theory than it's a few angry old men yelling at clouds.
In reality, Bitcoiners are the "they took our jobs" crowd in South Park.

If we used Bitcoin as money, loans would become prohibitively expensive. No more credit cards or mortgages. Every crisis worsened by deflation as nobody can borrow to wait it out. Mass layoffs, bankruptcies. Power concentrated in the hands of a few HODLers. Aka the 17th century.

Fiat is not a problem. It's the solution to problems that arose from the use of money founded on the same principles as Bitcoin.
Taking a failed concept & putting it on the Internet doesn't solve anything.

With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank! Unless you need to take out a loan. Or get a mortgage. Or a credit card. Or, basically, anything but a wire transfer.

Everything comes down to the same problem: you cannot expect all people to be well informed. The modern world is too complex. You can't assume everyone is able to read a bank's balance sheet and decide if it's creditworthy or not. The free market is a dentist with a hammer.


Crypto economy experts who think limited money supply is great should read any book about the 19th century. States & companies defaulted every 20 years, or had to pillage to pay back creditors. You would have lost your wealth by sword or default. How is it better than inflation?

## Bubble Investing Game?

This multiplayer online crypto investing game is super realistic. You've got everything: "news", "charts", "IPOs", "companies" & "profits".
But to play you WILL need to spend a lot on in-app purchases of coins, because the ones you get for free are pretty useless.
My rating: 3/5.

Remember, Bitcoin bulls, in three years, you won't even be able to see this small $14,000 correction on the Bitcoin chart!
To change that, you'll need to go to Edit > Chart Settings > Defaults > Time Frame, and select "3 years" instead of "2 years".
Then you'll be able to see it.

## 100% Trustless?

Businesses accept cryptocurrencies because they hope they'll be able to transfer the sale proceeds to an online exchange, sell against fiat & wire the fiat to their bank accounts.
Cryptocurrencies are a trustless payment system in the sense that trust has been replaced with hope.
-- [9 Apr 2018](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/983322806078320640)


Bitcoin is the perfect trustless currency.
To get involved, simply give your credit card number and ID copy to a website you don't know, hoping that a piece of code you have never read will make you rich, because a guy on Twitter you've never met told you so.

100% TRUST-LESS.

## (Crypto Currency) Exchanges

Cryptocurrency exchanges are unregulated, unaudited entities where insiders trade against clients.
It's the equivalent of a roulette table at an underground casino, where the mob boss looks at all the bets on the table & then decides which number will come up.
Don't trade crypto.
-- [4 Apr 2018](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/981769815349190658)


If cryptocurrency exchange insiders are allowed to trade on their own exchange, other traders don't stand a chance.
Insiders know the stop orders of everyone else. They can push the market to execute said orders, at no risk of their own.
You call it "volatility", I call it fraud.

Hurry! It's probably the last time you'll be able to sell your magic internet coins above $8000 to some sucker trying to flip them to another sucker trying to flip them to another sucker.
-- [11 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/995185725846024192)



Crypto exchanges cooking their books should be the last nail in cryptocurrencies' coffin. Virtual magical coins are nothing without exchanges where they can be sold to suckers for real money.
Sit back & enjoy the show of crypto clowns shitting their pants as their scam collapses.

## Blockchains like the Early Internets Days

Bitcoin is like the Internet in 1996 - if instead of building websites, everyone just bought up domain names and waited for their prices to moon.
How is the ecosystem supposed to evolve, if nobody is using the tech for its purpose?
Unless HODL turns into SPEDN, Bitcoin is a joke.

Yes unregulated and unchecked flows of money always attract the best people. I'll go get my popcorn.

It's difficult to keep up with all the innovations in the Bitcoin space. Bitcoin Cash, SegWit, the Lightning Network... every 3 months, a new ground-breaking and revolutionary technology is born, attempting to solve some problem we never had before Bitcoin.

When CNBC tells you that Bitcoin is very much undercovered and unknown of the public.
When tweets forecasting Bitcoin at $50 000 get thousands of likes and retweets.
THEN you know it's safe to buy Bitcoin, because you're super early, kinda like an Internet investor in the 1980's.

"Blockchain is like the Internet, and cryptocurrencies are like Internet stocks."
Although these statements make no sense when you know a little bit of technology, finance or history, if you believe them, you should google what happened to Internet stocks. Hint: way of the dodo.

## Blockchain a Database?

Being a blockchain enthusiast must be so nerve wrecking.
You keep seeing headlines like "Company X just used blockchain to do Y", & you get pumped up. This is it! It's happening!
Then you read the article & you realise X just used blockchain as a database to digitise some papers.

For corporations, blockchain technology will be as disrupting and revolutionary as email and computer databases put together.
Unless they already use email and databases. Then it will just slow them down.

I'm moonlighting as a blockchain consultant.
If you want your organisation to be on top of things & save millions of dollars, you need me.

## (Crypto Currency) Applications

### Steem

Anyone who can explain how Steemit is not a Ponzi scheme gets 1,000 Trolly coins.
Everyone who comments or upvotes the explanation gets some Trolly coins, too.

Trolly coins are very valuable because they are scarce, even if I don't have any revenue whatsoever to back them up.
